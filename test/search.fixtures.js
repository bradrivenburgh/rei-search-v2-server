                "Absolutely must see this 3 bedroom 1.5 bath home with a touch of modern farmhouse and original charm. This lovely 2 story brick front home is 16 feet wide, 70 feet deep and over 1,344 square feet of living space. Details make this home incredibly special. We love that many of the original features have been preserved and reworked into the design. Enter in through a formal vestibule that has a beautiful marble tile floor and a glass transition door leading to inlaid hardwood floors in the living and dining rooms. The main floor is extremely spacious with an open concept floor plan, original oversized decorative molding under the 2 front windows and oversized base trim, both of which you do not see in many homes. The formal living and dining room has recessed lights that lead to the kitchen. The dining room also offers a bonus closet space for coats and storage. The half bath which is located between the kitchen and dining room is a small masterpiece with a full wall of random plank hardwood paired with an antique floating wash basin with a sink/wall mounted faucet reminiscent of the original home's period finishes. The door to the powder room and the basement are repurposed 5 panel solid wood doors with crystal knobs that clearly add character to daily function. The kitchen is a show stopper with 2 tone cabinetry, open framed shelving above the top cabinets with a built in light package, polished granite counters, under cabinet lighting, white subway backsplash and a high-end stainless appliance package that includes a full-size refrigerator with freezer drawer and a water and ice feature, a backless convection oven with 5 burner gas range, and a dishwasher. The microwave shelf, which is built in, is placed in a very convenient spot located in a custom service nook that would make the perfect coffee station. This kitchen has enough space for a a dining table as you see in the photos, including a chandelier, a ceiling fan, and 3 windows that fill the room with natural light. From the kitchen you can access the private rear yard with a covered patio area and a green space for those of you who enjoy relaxing outdoors, have pets, a green thumb, or all of the above! The 2nd floor has 3 spacious bedrooms and a hall bath. The bedrooms have neutral colored plush carpeting and ceiling fans and the hallway is hardwood. The hall bath was completely reworked with octagonal marble tile floor, a glass enclosed soaking tub and shower combo with subway tile, and a beautiful rustic vanity with storage, an oversized sink basin, marble countertop, and a circular mirror pulling this space together to perfection. There is a large full sized basement with laundry and utilities, tons of storage space and a definite possibility to finish if desired. The home offers central air and forced hot air heat. Located in 19125, walkable, close to shopping, local restaurants, and cafe's. We are very excited to share this home with you. We welcome your visit today.",

This 2.5 bedroom, 1 bath home is freshly painted, with new flooring, and brand new appliances. The kitchen was just updated with new granite countertops, tall white cabinets, stainless steel appliances, and tile floor. Off the kitchen is a private paved patio, ready to become your secluded garden. The second floor has a full bathroom, and two separate bedrooms. The back bedroom is essentially two rooms. It could work as an extra sitting/work/home gym area. The front bedroom is also a decent size. Plenty of room for your imagination . The basement is unfinished, and has laundry and other mechanicals. This owner is very motivated.",

                'Green Roof Top Decks with a view in Port Richmond / Harrowgate. These monster homes will definitely take your dollar a long way with approximately 2550 sq ft of living space. Enter the homes into the open concept floor plan which means all rooms on the first floor are open to eachother. This concept is terrific for entertaining and keeping an eye on everyone at the same time. Exit the rear through the glass sliding door to the rear yard where you\'ll be able to setup your BBQ area and seating for relaxing. The full finished basement is sure to be the place to setup your home theater, additional living room space or game room. Take the stairs up to the second floor and check out the two large bedrooms - one in the rear and one in the front of the home. In between the bedrooms you will see the shared full bathroom and we have placed the full sized laundry room on the second floor hallway for easy access and convenience. Head on up to the third floor where you will find the owner suite complete with large closet system and four piece bathroom (shower stall, dual vanity sinks, soaking tub and toilet) and rounded out with a linen closet for additional storage. Finally, head up to the green roof top deck from the hallway stairs and check out the amazing views of the Philadelphia Skyline.  DISCLAIMER: The photos in this listing showing the completed staged home is of another project but the builder intends the interiors of the subject property to be similar. Finishes may vary depending on availability. Green Roof Top Decks w Benefits: 1) Reduced heating and cooling costs.German studies show that green roofs help a home retain up to 50 per cent of the heat typically lost to convection. A Canadian study found that a green roof reduces the average daily energy demand for air conditioning by up to 75 per cent in the spring and summer.  2) Extended life of roofing materials by 2-3 times longer. 3) Reduced noise-pollution impact. 4) Beauty and biodiversity. 5) Diminished rainwater runoff. A green roof acts like a sponge during rainstorms, absorbing about 40 per cent of the rainwater. 6) Less carbon dioxide and more oxygen in the air. More plants equal cleaner air because plants actually collect carbon dioxide from the air and, as a byproduct of photosynthesis, replenish the air with oxygen. The plants on a residential green roof produce more oxygen than a typical fmly uses in a year. 7) Diminished "urban heat island effect." TAXES TBD and Assessed by OPA - the amounts in this listing are estimated based on once the tax abatement goes into affect.',

                "Nothing left to do except move-in to this fabulous 3 bedroom, 2 and a half bath brick and stone twin in beautiful Mount Airy!! The first thing you'll notice as you come up the walkway is the care the current owners have taken with their front yard. The fragrant lilac bushes, lush perennials, irises, hydrangea and so much more greet you as you make your way to the door. Through the vestibule and into the living room, you can see so much of the original charm and character is still intact. Crown molding, original white oak hardwood floors w/ walnut inlay and beautiful stained, leaded glass windows are only just some of the charm in this lovely home. The spacious, bright living room is so inviting with it's high ceilings, new recessed lighting and a grand stone fireplace (wood burning) that is the focal point of the room. There is an ample dining room where the crown molding and hardwood floors continue and then into a large eat-in cook's kitchen, resplendent with custom cabinets, breakfast bar, deep porcelain farmhouse sink with gooseneck faucet, granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances and gas cooking. Upstairs to the 2nd floor you'll find the spacious master bedroom with double closets at the entryway and a wall of custom closets to your right. There is an en-suite bathroom with a glass doored shower and another one of those wonderful stained, leaded glass windows. There is a full hall bath with a deep tub, a marble topped sink and another lovely window. 2 other sunny, spacious bedrooms, both with deep closets and a hallway linen and cedar closet complete the floor. Make your way down to the sizable finished basement, with recessed lighting and another grand stone fireplace (wood burning), plus a convenient half bath. Outside there is a fenced yard and patio and a detached 2 car garage with the original slate overhang. With newer HVAC system, newer roofs on both home and garage, tons of closet space and close to transportation, shopping and a quick drive to Center City, this property is a win win for anyone looking for their new forever home!",
